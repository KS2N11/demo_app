Tasks:
1. Data quality overview in the dashboard still shows encoded column names, either fix that or show them with names that make more sense to the user.

2. In site performance details in the dashboard page, the eligibility rate colors are too bright and the values within it are not visible.

3. The preset chart gallery should only show the preset charts available for the user to see, the rest should be hidden. It would not make sense for the user to open the preset charts and see messages like this: Preset chart 'site_distribution' not available with current data

4. When selecting a custom chart which requires selection of x and y axis, we can select from any of the columns in the x-axis, but for y-axis only a few columns are available for selection, look into this and fix it.

5. The correlation heatmap is too small and not visible in custom charts page and also uses encoded column values and displays them. Make the same fix as mentioned in task 1 in this as well.
