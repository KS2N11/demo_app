Tasks:
1. My demo application should accept a csv in any format with any number of columns and any number of rows. Even the names of the columns should not matter.

2. All the insights and charts generated should be generated dynamically based on the data present in the csv provided. I will only upload csv files with data of clinical trials in them so you need not worry about validation.

3. Also, when I upload any file the page keeps on flickering. 

Make all necessary changes required for carrying out these tasks in the codebase.
